                      -- ARM --

This project is an RSA signature device.

This project has been made by:
    - Vincent Deville
    - Kevin Tavukciyan
    - Noemie de Martimprey


* FEATURES

    The MCU is loaded with a bootloader which have the following features:
                - verify that the software to start is authenticated (signed)
                - update the software to start in a secure way
                  (it is not possible to put an arbitrary binary in flash)
                - start the software in flash

    The software to start will have the following features:
                - generates an RSA private key (only one time)
                - exports the associated public key on the UART
                - sign a hash (sha-256) provided via the UART
                  with the private key
                - protects the use of the private key with a password


* LAUNCHING

    In order to launch you need to do theses commands:
      ``


* LIBRARY

    This project uses the library Mbedtls 2.11.
    The library is used mainly in the generation of the RSA keys,
    indirectly in the export on UART of the public key and in the generation of the signature
    of the hash.
